Code Career Academy was a coding bootcamp in the Atlanta, Georgia area run by software industry veteran, Pluralsight Author, and Microsoft MVP, Jeff Ammons.

It ceased operations in 2018, but Jeff has now founded a new online educational materials company that hosts the video version of his curriculum at [CCALearn.Tech](https://ccalearn.tech).
